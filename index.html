                <h1>What is an Escape Room?</h1>
                <p>Real-life room escape games are a type of physical adventure game in which people are technically locked in a room with other participants and have to use elements of the room to solve a series of puzzles, find clues, and escape the room within 30, 45 or 60 minutes depending on the room and location.</p>

                    <h3>A:</h3>
                    <p>This depends on the room you want to do. If you click "Book Now" for the location you want, you will see "Available" with a number for each room. This is the most each room can hold, and is based mostly around the size of each room. The minimum amount of people we can have for each room is 2.

                    <h3>A:</h3>
                    <p>Anybody can do an escape room! 14 and under must be accompanied by an adult (18+), and 5 and under are free, but anybody is welcome in!</p>

                    <h3>A:</h3>
                    <p>Yes! All of our rooms are private, so if the max for a room is 10 and your group of 7 books it, the room will be blocked off so nobody else can join.</p>

                    <p>Can my the people in my group pay separately?</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>A:</h3>
                    <p>Yes! Because all the rooms are private, if you book the first set of people and worry the room is full when the rest of your party hasn't paid, no problem. The rest of your party can pay upon arrival, no need to call ahead.</p>
