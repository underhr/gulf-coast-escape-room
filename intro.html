        <h1>What To Expect</h1>
        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>The most important part of any escape room is communication between everybody in the room. Make sure everybody in the room knows when you find a clue, solve a puzzle, or need some help. For example, if you have a box that won't open until you put in the right five-letter word, and your friend found a secret passage in a book with a five-letter word circled, you won't put those two pieces together unless you're talking. It might be wise to assign a leader to keep track of what's going on.</p>
        <h3>Stay Organized</h3>
        <p>It helps to put all of the clues you've found in one place, & group similar items together. Once you've used something or solved something, you may want to set it aside in another area designated as a “discard” pile, to ensure nobody gets caught up on something that's already been used or solved. This helps ensure everyone is on the same page, & is working on something that hasn't already been finished.</p>
        <h3>Escape Rooms Are For Everybody</h3>
        <p>Whether you're 5 or 85, escape rooms are a blast. For the gamers, puzzle addicts, tourists looking for an immersive activity, or locals looking to get out of the house, our escape rooms are sure to give your group a memory that will last forever.</p>
